# Symptom-Based-Plant-Disease-Classification

This project introduces a strategy for diagnos- ing plant diseases, which goes beyond traditional image-based classification methods by incorporating predictive symptom analysis. Unlike previous approaches that solely rely on images, our method combines image analysis with textual symptom descrip- tions generated by a language model, Gemini-vision-pro which provided a more comprehensive understanding of the disease. Through training on diverse datasets, a multi-modal approach was developed that is capable of classifying diseases, with the aim of enhancing interpretability and practical utility. Four Convolutional Neural Network models which includes VGG16, Densenet InceptionV3 and a bespoke CNN model are compared along with leveraging fusion techniques to integrate information of image and text features. Densenet seemed to be the most reliable model with a training accuracy of 95.5% and a validation accuracy of 85% among all. This demonstrated the ability to not only classify the disease but also comprehend the significance of the prediction made by the model to classify the disease. This approach not only enhances disease diagnosis but also holds immense potential for agriculture by empowering farmers with an effective tool for disease detection and sustainable crop management.
